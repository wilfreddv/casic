# Casic

Casic is a toy language loosely based on BASIC. It's a statically typed language with type inference.

## How to build
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
make
make libcasic.o
```

## Todo
* Code generation
* I/O
* Standard library
* Functions/procedures
* Includes
### Would be cool
* IR optimization
* Precompiled includes
* Interface with other compiled code (e.g. C/C++)
